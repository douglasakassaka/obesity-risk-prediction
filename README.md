# Obesity Risk Prediction & Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was developed for a hospital environment to assist medical teams in predicting obesity risk levels. Using machine learning, the system classifies patients based on their physical condition and lifestyle habits.

## 📊 Business Context
Obesity is a multifactorial medical condition. The goal of this tool is to provide a data-driven approach for early diagnosis and personalized health recommendations.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.13
* **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-Learn (Random Forest Classifier)
* **Deployment:** Streamlit
* **Model Serialization:** Joblib

## 📈 Key Results
* **Model Accuracy:** 91.80% ✅
* **Dataset:** 2,111 obesity records from UCI dataset
* **Classification Categories:** 7 obesity levels (Insufficient Weight to Obesity Type III)
* **Best Performing Features:** Weight, Height, Calorie monitoring, Physical activity frequency
* **Model Type:** Random Forest (100 estimators)
